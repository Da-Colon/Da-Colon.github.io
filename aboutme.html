                <h1 class="title">About me!</h1>
                <p class="text-style text-indent">Hello everyone, My name is David Colon! I am a future (current?)
                    student in the
                    August 2019 Cohort at DigitalCrafts. My interest into coding and programming goes way back but I
                    always thought it was something that only a genuis could do. So I never really looked into it. I
                    have always been interested in computers and what makes them tick but never explored any deeper than
                    surface level.</p>
                <p class="text-style text-indent">My background consists of 12 years in the restuarant industry in the
                    back of house. I thought that this is where I will be good at as I seem to excell with everything
                    that the
                    job required. Leadership, you got it, teamwork, yep, ability to exceed in customer service. you
                    betcha and I found my self in a manager position. I thought that this was what I wanted and slowly
                    found myself wanting more. I tried to expand my knowledge and worked at a fine dineing restuarant
                    and I found myself thinking that this wasn't enough.</p>
                <p class="text-style text-indent"> Thats when I discovered some online resources codecademy.com and
                    freecodecamp.org, my
                    interest was peeked. I started doing the assignments and found my self diving deeper and deeper.
                    After talking over my career change options with my fiancee, I decided to look into a bootcamps and
                    found myself attracted to DIgitalCrafts because of everything that was taught and it being located
                    at a community like Atlanta Tech Village. I am absolutely looking forward with working with everyone
                    attending this cohort and making lifelong connections that will benefit each other throughout our
                    careers.</p>

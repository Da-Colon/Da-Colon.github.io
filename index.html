                <p class="text-style">In this day and age of highly processed food it's more important than ever that
                    everyone should set aside some time pull up your favorite recipe book or website and make something
                    for your friends, family, or significant other.
                    You don't have to be a professional cook to find easy recipes that use fresh ingrediants. Today's
                    culture of instant gradification from everything from a Netflix binge of your favorite show, to your
                    trip to your favorite casual or fast food restaurant.
                    The idea of "I don't have the time" or "I can't cook to save my life" is a sad thing that too many
                    say. These statements couldn't be further from the truth.</p>
                <p class="text-style">There are so many recipes that not only take very little time to prep but also
                    have a set and forget (with a timer of course!) style. I'll try to cover a phew different topics but
                    I believe that everyone should learn how to cook and have some fun while doing it. Anyone can be a
                    home Chef!</p>

                <p class="text-style">There are many ways to cook whether you have hours to prepare or just 10 mins.
                    While there are many different ways to cook there is no one way is better than another.</p>
                <h3 class="center">Here are just a few different ways you can cook:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li class="li-title text-style">Stovetop:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="text-style li-indent">Whether you saut√®, boiling, steaming or frying you have
                            probably used done one of these things at least once. Unless, of course, you've been eating
                            microwave food your whole life, hint: thats not healthy!. If your stove can either be
                            electric or gas (I personally prefer Gas).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                    </ul>
                    <li class="li-title text-style">Baking:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="li-indent text-style">Depending on what your bakng, most of the work is done in prep.
                            Once it's in the oven you can set a timer and keep an eye on in until it is done. While
                            throwing a roast and some seasoned veggies in a pan takes very little technical know how,
                            baking a cake relies on exact measurements to ensure a proper cook on the cake.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li class="li-title text-style">Grilling:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="li-indent text-style">My personal favorite. There is nothing like heating up some
                            charcoal and with just some oil, salt and pepper, prepare meals from a variety of different
                            ingrediants. Sometimes it's okay to even bast with some sauces and marinades through the
                            cooking process. This method does require a little more of your attention than the others as
                            you are working with an open flame.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li class="li-title text-style">Smoking:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="li-indent text-style">A great way to incorporate different aromas into mostly meats
                            and fish, smoking usually calls for wood chips. Smoked Salmon is a classic favorite.</li>

                <p class="text-style">I won't go into to much detail in this section as there are so many tools for the
                    trade that this would take several pages to talk about all the knick-knacks in a chef's toolbox. A
                    sharp knife set that is a must for any chef. There is a style of knife made for every use that you
                    would need it for. A general purpose chef knife, a small handy paring knife for the smaller tasks.
                    or maybe you need to prepare a fresh fish, for that you'll need the flexible and very sharp filet
                    knife. Dependng on what your preparing it's good to have several measuring tools, measuring spoons
                    and cups, and a scale. A blender for purees, a food processor for your favorite salsa, as I said I
                    could go on and on.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="text-style">Speaking of knives one thing that I would train any new chef is to learn proper
                    handling and storage of knives. In a professional kitchen these are perhaps the most utilized tool.
                    If your knives are not maintained and properly cleaned and stored, not only can they
                    cross-contaminate your diffrent ingrediants but a dull knife is more dangerous in some instances
                    than a sharp one. For example if you are cutting something with soft skin such as a tomato and the
                    knife is dull it can roll causing you to cut yourself pretty badly. I recommend using a cutting
                    glove for those not use to using new knives. When holding something while cutting it's always a must
                    to hold the item like a claw with your fingers tilted inside so if a roll does occur none of your
                    fingers are in the direct path of a knife. They should always be cleaned and dryed after use and
                    properly stored in the knife block or put away in a proper storage area. I cannot stress enough they
                    anyone handling knives use caution and be aware of your surroundings. </p>
